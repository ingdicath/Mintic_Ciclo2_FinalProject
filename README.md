## Requirements :pushpin:

For this project, we used **mysql 8.0.26**, **Java 8** and **Netbeans** IDE. 

Before start, be sure you setup the basic tools for running java and sql:

1. SQL: 
	- Install [mysql](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) in your pc.
	- It is highly recommended download [MSQLWorkBench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/), [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/download/) or any other SQL editor of your choice.

2. Java:
	- Install [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and JDK.
	- Install an IDE like Netbeans, IntelliJ or any other IDE of your choice.
	- JDBC component, for [connection between sql and Java](https://github.com/ingdicath/Mintic_Ciclo2_FinalProject/tree/main/PetStoreDiDi/lib).

## Design process :bulb:

1. We created a DB in sql through a [script](https://github.com/ingdicath/Mintic_Ciclo2_FinalProject/blob/main/PetStoreDiDi/src/util/db_creation.sql), building tables and records from scratch.

2. We verified if the Entity-relationship (ER) diagram was correct according to our design, using the "Reverse Engineer" option provided by MySQLWorkBench.

In this case, the relation between "propietario" and "mascota" is __one to many__, it means one "propietario" or owner can holder many "mascotas" or pets.
In the same way, the relation between "mascota" and "cita" is also __one to many__, it means one "mascota" or pet can holder many "citas" or appointments.

3. Having the DB, we created the file sources for the project. We designed our project based on three-layers architecture MVC.
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ingdicath/Mintic_Ciclo2_FinalProject/blob/main/images/mvc.png" width="60%" height="60%"></p>


4. We have six packages in total:

- **Controller**: this is the bridge between the view and the model, in this case, for the pet summary and the owner. Here are the click events for each button in the app defined as well.
- **dao**: contains DAO for owner and pet summary.
- **main**: contains the main. Running this file allows to see the app.
- **model**: contains the model for owner and pet summary.
- **util**: where the user needs to set up the parameters for the connection to the SQL DB and where the connection is established as well.
- **view**: where is set up the Frame and Panel features for the main window, Owner and Pet summary.

## How to use :hammer:

1. Clone the repository in your local machine.
2. Open a new project in your IDE and copy the folder src.
3. Add into "Libraries" the mysql-connector-java file, located in this repo in [lib folder](https://github.com/ingdicath/Mintic_Ciclo2_FinalProject/tree/main/PetStoreDiDi/lib).
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/ingdicath/Mintic_Ciclo2_FinalProject/blob/main/images/mysql-conector-java.png" width="60%" height="60%"></p>

4. Go to package **main** and run "PetStoreDiDi.java".
