## Design process :bulb:

1. We created a DB in sql through a [script](https://github.com/ingdicath/Mintic_Ciclo2_FinalProject/blob/main/PetStoreDiDi/src/util/db_creation.sql), building tables and records from scratch.
2. We verified if the Entity-relationship (ER) diagram was correct according to our design.
